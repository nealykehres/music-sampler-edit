<p> Bob Dylan was born in 1941 in Duluth, Minnesota. He released his self-titled first album in 1962 when he was only 20 years old. His music is deeply rooted in rich American folk tradition. For his third album, "The Times They Are A-Changin'", released in 1964, he wrote all of the lyrics and music. His lyrics often incorportated social and political themes, as well as those of love, relationships and religion.</p>

  <p> Dylan continues to write lyrics and music, and he reached the pinnacle of success as a lyricist when he was awarded the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature. He was the first lyricist to receive the award. The academy said the prize was awarded to Dylan “for having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition.” Click on the tambourine icon below to reveal four Bob Dylan albums, and then select one to hear a song featuring some of Dylan's earliest legendary lyrics.</p>
